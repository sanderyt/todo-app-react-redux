Motivation to choose the techs
## React
I have choosen React as front-end because I like to work with React, understand it well, in which I can develop the app way faster. Get a deep understanding of React, because of the high demand for React devs. React is scalable, because you make components once and can reuse them in your app, which makes development fast and your app maintainable. 

## Redux
To learn Redux and state management, I find it difficult in my experience when the app is growing to access state from components. You have to pass down props many times in your components. With Redux you can access your state from any component, which makes it eventually easier to debug and find errors.

## Firebase
Firebase SDK comes with handy methods to authenticate users. Easy to setup back-end with Firebase and want to dig deeper in this service of Google. Easy to use methods, which returns errors etc.

Thanks Emile!
